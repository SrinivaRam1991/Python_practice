Lower budget 



Excellent car excellent car, But definitely can't be a family car.Although rider comfort is fabulous rear seat is not so comfortable for long rides, Especially for elderly people.Access to the rear seat is through the front seat so won't recommend it for elderly people.But for bachelors and newly married couples an amazing investment.Worth the cost.Also, It has less boot space so will be recommended for the touring purpose only when it's about a couple of guys else that can be extensively used for adventure activities.Its four-wheel drive along with hill assist and power is amazing.Overall a satisfying deal as you get a jeep-like feel on a lower budget.The model is superb.

High automotive fuel prices are forcing buyers to look at alternative fuel options, and the two most suitable substitutes at present are CNG and electric. While it's widely known that both these options reduce running costs compared with petrol, there is also a premium you pay to buy them in the first place. As far as small CNG cars go, the boot space is still quite usable and because the spare is kept under the tank, the space left behind the tank can be easily used. The EV, while being much better than the CNG in terms of boot space, is still behind the petrol model. This is because the battery pack is placed under the boot which has raised the boot floor up. Also, because the spare wheel has nowhere else to go, it takes up room on the boot floor. Still, you can accommodate multiple suitcases and soft bags here. The driving experience is easily the biggest differentiator between the three. We are all familiar with ICE vehicles and how they feel to drive. The key aspect which makes petrol or diesel vehicles better and easier to drive than other ICE cars is the refinement of the engine, which is judged by the noise and vibrations. The electric motor in an EV has almost no noise and vibrations and this is what sets its driving experience apart. The absolute silent start-up and drive, and the effortless acceleration, make this the best driving experience of the three. Even the performance of the EV is in a different class than its conventional cousins. Moreover, we would suggest you to take a test drive before making the final decision. Follow the link and select your desired city for dealership details.	"

Yes it is a good buy i think...	"
"
Any information folks ??	"
"
As per your requirement, there's an only electric car available: Strom Motors R3. Choosing one will depend on several factors such as budget, brand preference, seating capacity, specific feature requirements etc. Click on the given link and apply filters in order to check out electric cars as per your requirements.	"
"
Selecting the right car would depend on certain factors such as your budget, features required, brand preference, comfort, cabin space, etc. As per your requirements, we would suggest you go for Polo. It still manages to do a lot right though in terms of solid build quality, strong set of essential features as standard and adds on top of that, great performance and a delightful driving experience. Moreover, we would suggest you take a test drive for a better understanding of performance and driving comfort. Follow the link and select your desired city for dealership.	"

AMT is like your normal gearbox, which a machine is operating at fixed speeds/rpms (you will feel gear changes and a slight jerk). whereas CVT (continuously variable transmission), is a shiftless , single-speed transmission. in simple ways there are no gears and you wont feel any shift, it will be a continuous velocity e.g. like your activa, or any other gearless scooters. On the other hand AMT is easy and not so costly in terms of maintenance, however CVTs are costly when repairs. FE is almost equal in both cases, nothing much difference.	"
"
In swift we get amt or as they call autogearshift(ags) it's not a continuous variable transmission(Cvt) as in a polo..which is way by superior...but better than many AMTs..no CVT in a swift ... "
"
AMT means automated manual transmission and CVT means continues variable transmission In AMT you can drive in auto mode and manaul mode but in CVT only Automatic mot manual transmission	"
"
Basically in a manual transmission it depends on the driver , full control I with the driver and manual transmission is always reliable and for spprty and thrilling experience manual is awesome . Mileage to goes good with manual transmission . But in automatic transmission it becomes boring Just press the accelerator and the car is going on its own ,the driver has just no control over the car , automatic transmission is a bit moddy If you go on a long drive then I would prefer manual transmission and also for thrilling experience	"
"
Automatic cars only benefit you if you often go for long drives(>100 km) and that too 4 or 5 times a month.Also automatic car is better for old aged and handicaped people.Since automatic cars have a higher price than the manual onea therefore it is just a wastage of money.Manual gearbox is way too better in performance espacially of you are driving on terrans and hilly roads.S	"
"
Manual has manual mood... automatic is however a moody car.. you cannot make a control over pickup amd pressure in automatic car. For sporty and thrilling drive you cannot choose automatic car. But it is good in traffic conditions in city. As it is easier to drive during rush hours.	"
"
Travel in metro or bus it would be safer don't get me wrong but 5 lakhs plz try to save for some more time and buy tata Tiago petrol nothing wrong in waiting some more time rather than buying a scrap which is good for nothing so wait for some time and buy your car you have to keep it for almost 5-6 years mini so don't buy anything randomly "
"
Don't take it wrongly bro but you can't expect a safe car at 5 L budget, you may get a good car preferably from Maruti like s presso , alto, Celerio and from renoult kwid, datson go , nisan Micra but their safety rattings are very low. still it's better than a two whiler. "
"
The most popular cars under 5 lakhs include Nissan Magnite (Rs. 4.99 Lakh), Renault KWID (Rs. 2.99 Lakh), and Tata Tiago (Rs. 4.70 Lakh or you may seek some financial help from any banks such as HDFC to go with cars such as i20.	"
"
You should go for a sedan car because the are best in comfort. If you have low budget then go for honda amaze diesel and if you can spent some more then go for verna diesel it is best. But don't go for a petrol car.	"
"
Tiago Diesel or Ford Figo Diesel versions are good safety-wise.Tiago is pocket-friendly while Ford Figo is by far the best diesel car in terms of fun.	"
"
It is a very good car you can definately go for it.it will give you aprox 19-21 on highway and 17-18 in city after its 3rd service.	"
